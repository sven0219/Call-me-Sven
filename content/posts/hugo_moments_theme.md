A few days ago, while I was hospitalized, a classmate asked me to help build a website for his company. We initially considered using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) (but later switched to [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/)). While looking for a theme, I found [Moments](https://github.com/FarseaSH/hugo-theme-moments.git), which felt really fun.

Today during my lunch break, I deployed my own [Moments site](https://moments.svenshen.com) with this theme and it looks pretty good.
