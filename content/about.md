## About Me

I graduated from an unknown second-tier university in Anhui Province in 2018. After graduation, I came to Shanghai in a somewhat confused state.

**The First Job**: Through the campus recruitment, I joined a software company. I switched from being a Java developer to an operation and maintenance engineer and worked there for more than two years. I witnessed the company grow from a team of over 20 people to a large company with more than 500 employees. During that period, I learned a great deal and met many people. However, there were always some things that I wasn't satisfied with in my work. Therefore, I left the company in 2020.

**The Second Job**: I joined an online education company. Unfortunately, in 2021, the state introduced the "Double Reduction" policy, so I left the company in 2022 as well.

**The Third Job**, which is my current job, is in a foreign enterprise.
